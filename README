============================================
A Preprocessor for Verilog HDL
============================================

This is a standalone preprocessor for the Verilog HDL language.
It is modified from the Verilog-PreProcessor of Verilog Perl tool 3.314.
Most of the code is written by the team led by Wilson Snyder.

What I may do in this project:
* Provide a standalone command line interface (without Perl).
* Replace the parts implemented in Perl to C++.
* Encapsulate the package in a separated namespace for better independence.
* Replace the C language features to C++.
* Optimise some code for better reading or performance.

Current stage:
Ongoing without any usage.
Pls stay tuned.
