============================================
A Preprocessor for Verilog HDL
============================================

This software is distributed under GPL v2.0 or later licenses.

This is a standalone preprocessor for the Verilog HDL language.
It is modified from the Verilog-PreProcessor of Verilog Perl tool 3.314.
Most of the code is written by the team led by Wilson Snyder.

What I have done in this project:
* Provide a standalone command line interface (without Perl).
* Replace the parts implemented in Perl to C++.
* Encapsulate the package in a separated namespace for better independence.

What I may do in the future:
* Replace the C language features to C++.
* Optimise some code for better reading or performance.

INSTALL GUIDE
Make sure you have GNU Make, gcc-g++, and boost library installed.
Use make to make the project.
The execute is named "vpreproc" in current directory.

Using
  vpreproc --help
for usage information.
